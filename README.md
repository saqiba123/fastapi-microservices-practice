 
# build a microservices-based architecture using basic services like:


User Service
Auth (JWT/OAuth)
Order Service
Product Service
Payment Service


## Tools We'll Use:
FastAPI: To create APIs

Uvicorn: To run the server

HTTPX: For service-to-service calls

JWT: For auth (we'll keep it minimal)

## pip install fastapi uvicorn (for running fastapi server) httpx (for making request) python-jose (for jwt)
